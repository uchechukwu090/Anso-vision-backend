# 📋 Quick Reference - Deploy in 60 Seconds

## What Was Fixed
1. **WAIT signals on trending moves** → Now shows BUY/SELL
2. **State flips every 2 sec** → Now stable for 20-30 sec

## One Command Deploy
```bash
cd "C:\Users\User\dyad-apps\Anso backend python"
python push_to_github.py
```

That's it. It will:
- ✅ Add all changes
- ✅ Commit with message
- ✅ Push to GitHub
- ✅ Show success/error

## What Changed (2 files)
| File | Change | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| context_aware_hmm.py | Decision logic rewrite | ~120 |
| hmm_model.py | State smoothing added | ~40 |

## Expected Results
```
Before: WAIT signal at 83,925 BTC (entire 5,167 pip move missed)
After:  BUY signal at 83,925 BTC (signal confirmed at 89,092)

Before: 20+ state flips per minute
After:  2-3 state flips per minute
```

## How to Verify
1. Frontend: Add BTCUSD to watchlist
2. Watch for: BUY/SELL signal (not WAIT)
3. Check: Signal doesn't flip every 2 seconds
4. Confidence: Should be 0.65-0.88 (not 0.2)
